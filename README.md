**What is the injustice we are solving?**

I want to deal with the injustice of how hate groups change the perception of social media users for the worse about a certain community/issue/person.


**Our Compassionate Solution:**

To solve this injustice of the online audience being wrongfully misled to believe hateful lies about some community/person
we will address general public misconceptions
by building an interactive online quizzing platform that lets a user learn the true scenario by getting involved in a process of choosing between the truth and the commonly believed lie.
